This site was developed as part of a university assignment to experiment with some API from Facebook, Google, and Twitter. 

The Design employs the ability to expand the site out to a larger platform, but currently only supports one section to accomodate the needs of the assignment. The Twitter account associated with this site has been deleted to avoid spam, but a new one will be created and reapplied to accomodate the functionality.

The band pages each have cover images found from a photoshoot on google, and the cover image is a free stock photo found on Pexel. Other images are not mine either.
